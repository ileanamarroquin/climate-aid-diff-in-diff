The project is supported by  the Prototype Carbon Funnd (PCF).  The Bank established PCF in July 1999, with the operational objective of mitigating climate change.  PCF supports projects  expected to generate  greenhouse gas emission reductions while complying with requirements of joint implementation(JI, Art.6.) and the clean development  mechanism (CDM,  Art. 12)  of Kyoto Protocol.  PCF purchases high quality greenhouse gas emission reductions, which could be registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol.  By transacting the business of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the PCF is developing  a knowledge base of business processes and practices to facilitate climate-friendly investment and provide input for the ongoing UNFCCC  negotiations. In this particular case, the project will facilitate reduction of CO2 emissions through substituting energy from coal  with clean energy from biomass  made of rice husk produced by the Chinadega rice  and flour mill.  Th1.5MW Rice Husk-to-Power plant will produce 100% of the electrical power used at the  mill, and the electricity not consumed would be sold to local, recently privatized  distribution company. By using  rice husk, which for the most part would have been disposed in  open land fills,  the construction and operation of this electrical plant will also reduce  the release of Methane in the atmosphere, which results from the decomposition of husk left in open areas.",,,https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P076246,,,,,0,,,0,,,UNIDENTIFIED,B,,Renewable energy,,,,

P102839,Latin America and Caribbean,Republic of Colombia,Pipeline,CO San Nicolas Avoided Deforestation,"Task Description This code is being created for the avoided deforestation component of the project;  while P098615 covers the reforestation component.  The Project seeks to actively promote and finance the establishment on abandoned pastures of forestry, agroforestry and sylvopastural systems (Table 1 ), including training and capacity building towards their sustainable management. To date, and after negotiation process with local stakeholders, a forest management plan has been agreed. This plan includes CDM reforestation project activities for a total of eligible land area of 11,352.9 ha, from this area 8,475 ha were considered for plantations in the project (see table 1 and 2). This is due to a) the discount of the land dedicated to firewood plantations and b) a further discount due to changes in landowners preferences. The project considers that this conservative approach is as an additional strategy to ensure the carbon potential expressed in the calculations. The project will be carried out in the sub-region of the valleys of San Nicolas, which is made up of 9 municipalities in the eastern part of the Province of Antioquia, Colombia, which cover 193,000 hectares, of which 72,000 will be used for the development of the project. The sub-region is the hydrographic basin of the rivers Negro and Nare, which supplies water for several hydroelectricity plants that are responsible for generating approximately 33% of the energy used in Colombia. This project formulates a Plan for Sustainable and Participatory Management that was drafted in the course of a consultation, during the last 20 months, with the communities of the region of San Nicolas, Antioquia. The project will be implemented by the Corporation MASBOSQUES, a public-private partnership integrated by the municipalities, the regional environmental authority, the landowners, the regional association of entrepreneurs (CEO) and two research institutions. It is aimed to ensure sustainable development in the region, combining production of timber and non-timber products and payments for environmental services (including carbon sequestration).

The proposed objective of the Project is to reduce the risk of urban flooding in target areas of Barranquilla#s eastern watershed. The PDO will be measured by tracking: i) percentage of streets in target areas that have drainage systems with  a determined flood design return period, ii) population living and working in risk-prone areas, iii) number of drainage inlets that are impeded due to solid waste in target areas.
 Description of Project Components of proposed project:
 Component 1: Flood Risk Identification and Awareness 
 1.1 Stormwater Drainage Master Planning: The outputs of the feasibility study of technical solutions will contribute to the definition of a Stormwater Drainage Master Plan with strong linkages to urban and transport planning that will guide the sequencing and nature of physical interventions required across the city.
 1.2 Flood Risk Knowledge: This involves studies for completing flood hazard identification, vulnerability and risk assessments (for example, probability of loss of life and property if the vulnerability is not addressed). 
 1.3 Education and Information Campaigns: The importance of risk mitigation and disaster preparedness will be introduced at various levels of the educational system and will involve the development and implementation of a multifaceted public information campaign improving public awareness of urban flooding and of roles and responsibilities of individual households and communities.
 Component 2: Flood Risk Reduction
 Based on the Stormwater Drainage Master Plan and flood risk mapping undertaken in Component 1, this component would initiate the first phase of physical interventions with investments in selected micro-basins. 
 2.1 Structural solutions: Current best management practice for high-impact and cost-effective solutions for flood mitigation is to retard peak flows in upstream/midstream areas by focusing on retention and detention. Such measures are high-impact as they slow the transfer time by capturing large volumes of water and utilize areas of infiltration. This component would therefore include detailed diagnostics of each #arroyo# with the objective of defining the appropriate portfolio of response measures to promote hydraulic capacity and reduce run-off levels following rain events by increasing water capture, making use of above- and below-ground storage, and promoting infiltration rates. Investments would be focused on identification and assessment of potential infrastructure and complementary alternatives. Investments would be focused on potential infrastructure alternatives and involve construction of selected options to promote hydraulic capacity and reduce run-off levels following rain events, including but not limited to canalization, pipes, culverts, pedestrian bridges, or use of Low-Impact Development (LID) solutions (i.e., pervious pavement).
 2.2 Non-structural solutions: Some of the contributing causes to the urban flooding in Barranquilla include blocking of the flood path as a result of litter and sediment deposition, and private properties (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) draining run-off directly onto city streets. Similarly, flood risk is increased by the presence of homes, businesses, and infrastructure in high-risk zones adjacent to the arroyos. This component would therefore focus on environmental mitigation measures such as assessing potential use of green infrastructure, improving solid waste collection/management practices,  and evaluating potential application of incentive mechanisms (i.e., property tax credits/subsidies) for implementation of run-off reducing measures (e.g., rainwater capture, green roofs, pervious driveways).

This operation  will focus on a narrow range of impactful but feasible measures that reflect such constraints and challenges. Politically uncontrov ersial measures are identified at the customs administration to improve domestic resource mobilization in the short term. Improving governance will prove challenging in the short to medium term, but this operation will focus on impactful policy actions that can he lp strengthen external control through enhancing the ability of the supreme audit institution (CSCCA) and the national procurement a gency to exercise rightful control on how public resources are spent. The current social protection system is weak, fragmented and u nder financed. The operation will focus on strengthening the role of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor (MAST) for a better co ordination of social programs and through increased sector spending. Finally, the countrys extreme vulnerability to natural hazard shocks has impeded its ability to sustain growth over the long term. The operation will try to strengthen the institutional framewor k for disaster risk management in sectors including preparedness and response and enhance financial capacity to manage the fiscal im pacts of disasters.
