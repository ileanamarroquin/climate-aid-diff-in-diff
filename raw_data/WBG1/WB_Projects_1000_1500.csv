P101206,Latin America and Caribbean,Plurinational State of Bolivia,Closed,Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequities Project (APL III)--Former Health Sector Reform - Third Phase (APL III),"The development objectives for APL III are the same as those of the previous two phases: increasing access to good quality and culturally appropriate health services to improve the health of the population in general and to mothers and children in particular.  As a medium-term objective, the APL series pursues reducing the infant and maternal mortality rates by one-third, as per the proposed indicators for the Program. 
  Under APLs I and II an important set of policies and interventions were developed to strengthen the performance of the public health services. These policies and interventions aimed to improve child and maternal health status, including expansion of the insurance system (the Universal maternal and child insurance, SUMI, at present), the investments in primary health care, and the strengthening of cost-effective health interventions (PAI, IMCI). APL I introduced a basic health insurance (the Seguro B?sico de Salud, today SUMI) to reinforce provisions to mothers and children, and a new vaccination system and set of new management tools. APL II is implementing an expanded version of maternal and child insurance, by supporting the deployment of mobile health brigades (EXTENSA) as a way of expanding service delivery to underserved areas, and new management tools (performance agreements, and demand-driven investment policy) are being used. The Government has provided sustainability to health insurance as well as to the EXTENSA program that is now being absorbed by the regional and/or municipal budgets. The EXTENSA Unit in the MOH that was part of the APL II PIU is being incorporated in the structure of the MOH.  All regions benefited with support from investments, mainly in primary care. 
 The proposed APL III aims to sustain the trend in improving the IMR and accelerate the reduction of the MMR, which a recent modeling exercise shows to be a challenge. APL III would consolidate the strategies implemented under APLs I and II by:  i) strengthening the regulatory capacity of national, regional and local levels to perform critical EFPH; ii) promoting the demand of maternal and infant health services through developing and enhancing the culturally appropriate maternal and infant health referral network; and iii) supporting implementation of the new expansion of the insurance system (Universal Health Insurance - SUSALUD.",,,https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P101206,2008-01-24T00:00:00Z,12/31/2015,,,16462005,,,16462005,,,Adaptable Program Loan,B,,Health,Central Government (Central Agencies),Sub-National Government,,

Moreover, the grant will create capacity within poor people and vulnerable groups to  analyze the information, and participate in policy discussions and program design.

Once in place these changes would help formulate and implement efficient and sustainable water resources management policies and plans by: (i) strengthening relevant federal and state institutions; (ii) decentralizing water resources management to river basin committees and local water user associations (WUAs); (iii) developing mechanisms and institutional arrangements to promote efficient use of resource, allocation and enforcement of water use rights; and (iv) setting up a well-coordinated monitoring and evaluation system to track project performance and assessment of its impact on beneficiaries.  Provide reliable and sustainable access to water for domestic, municipal , and other uses in priority river basins in the Northeast, by: (i) supporting the construction and/or installation of storage/conveyance structures and distribution networks to optimize the storage, delivery, and use of  water supplies within selected areas with high concentration of poor rural households; and (ii) establishing sustainable administration, operation and maintenance (A, O&M) systems for water supply infrastructure, including sound and efficient cost-recovery mechanisms.

  The benefits of the operation can be divided into three levels. At the first level, the operation brings benefits in terms of reinforcing the Fiscal Responsibility Law and Brazil#s system of fiscal federal checks and balances.  As discussed elsewhere in this document, this system has been fundamental to assuring Brazil#s national macroeconomic stability since the Real Plan, and by reinforcing the successful adjustment of Brazil#s second largest state, the operation has considerable significance at the national level.
 Second, within the state itself, the fiscal adjustment combined with improved economic performance will lead to poverty reduction both through higher incomes and through increased spending available for direct poverty-reducing spending, such as education, health, and basic local infrastructure. Work at the national level suggests that the elasticity of poverty with respect to economic growth in Brazil is about one, and Minas is unlikely to be a significant exception to this statistical regularity at the level of the country.  Furthermore, there is a 25% headcount ratio of poverty in the state.  This implies that a one percent increase in economic growth is likely to reduce poverty in Minas by about a quarter of a percentage point per year, or one percent every four years.
 Third, the improvements in the quality of public management in Minas will bring better service delivery to the poor.

  The project will contribute to reductions in local airborne pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport sector in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City (MCMA). This will be sought through the development of the first surface mass transport corridor in Mexico City (Insurgentes Avenue) and associated traffic management measures. 
 The project is also intended to develop and demonstrate the catalytic use of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to foster technology, regulatory and institutional changes in the public transport sector.  It will also develop and implement tools required to measure and monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from the transport sector. While the operation of one single corridor does not result in large emission reductions, the project will help to develop the tools and procedures that may be applied, on a larger stage as a follow up to this operation. The availability of certified emission reductions is expected to accelerate this process.  Thus, the project will demonstrate that a high-quality bus corridor approach is a viable alternative for promoting a modal shift. In this context, the project will provide a valuable blueprint for other corridors in the city and elsewhere which could bring about a much higher overall impact.",METROBUS,,https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P082656,2005-11-04T00:00:00Z,8/17/2016,,,49400000,,,49400000,,,Specific Investment Loan,B,,Roads and highways,,,,
