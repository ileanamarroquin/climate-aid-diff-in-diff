About 70 percent of these families are in rural areas, 16 percent live in semi-urban areas, with the remaining 14 percent in urban areas.  The principal project development objectives are: 
  â€¢	Complement the income of poor families with children 
 â€¢	Increase the accumulation of human capital in extremely poor families throughimprovements in their access to education, health and nutrition. 
 â€¢	Improve program quality 
 In the area of program quality, the project would support several innovations being tested by the Program which aim at improving for Oportunidades families, the quality of health and education services received,  linkages to other services (for example, early childhood development programs, tertiary level educational scholarships and employment services), and ethnic pertinence. 
 Oportunidades is a mature major social assistance program, with a positive impact already well demonstrated through rigorous evaluations in many important areas â€“ higher consumption (particularly â€œhigh-qualityâ€ food consumption (fruit and vegetables)), reductions in poverty levels, child labor, infant and maternal mortality and disease, adult illness and chronic disease, and higher school enrollment (concentrated at the transition from the primary to the secondary level).  Thus continued implementation of the Program according to its established procedures would achieve the first two development objectives.  The following key indicators will be used.   The correspondence of each indicator to the development objectives is shown in Annex 3. In some cases reference is made to the evidence already accumulated.  For the improvements in program quality, there are a set of indicators related to the design and implementation of each innovative activity. 
 â€¢	Net improvement in household total, food (including fruits and vegetables) and protein consumption. 
 â€¢	Net improvement in child nutrition status and in adult and child health status
